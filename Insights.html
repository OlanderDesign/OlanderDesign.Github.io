      <h3>The 5 stages of group development</h3>
      <p>The Tuckman model, also known as Tuckman's stages of group development, describes five phases of team development that teams typically go through as they work on a project or task. These stages are:</p>
      <ol><blockquote>
        <li><b>Forming:</b> This is the initial stage of team development, where team members are introduced to each other and begin to establish relationships. They are focused on getting to know each other and understanding the goals of the project.</li>
        <li><b>Storming:</b> During this phase, team members may start to have disagreements or conflicts as they begin to work together. This can be a challenging stage, but it is also an important one for building trust and establishing effective communication within the team.</li>
        <li><b>Norming:</b> In this stage, team members start to work more cohesively and establish a shared vision for the project. They start to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and work collaboratively towards the common goal.</li>
        <li><b>Performing:</b> At this stage, the team is fully functional and working together effectively towards the project goals. They have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities and are able to work efficiently and effectively to achieve success.</li>
        <li><b>Adjourning:</b> The final stage of the Tuckman model is when the project is completed, and the team members go their separate ways. At this stage, the team reflects on their success and the challenges they faced and may celebrate their achievements together.</li>

      <h3>The 5 dysfunctions model</h3>
      <p>The Lencioni 5 dysfunctions model is a framework for understanding the common challenges that teams face and how to overcome them. The model proposes that there are five key dysfunctions that can undermine team performance, and these are:</p>
      <ol><blockquote>
        <li><b>Absence of trust:</b> The first dysfunction is the absence of trust among team members. This can occur when team members are not open and vulnerable with each other, leading to a lack of honesty and a reluctance to admit mistakes or weaknesses.</li>
        <li><b>Fear of conflict:</b> The second dysfunction is the fear of conflict. When team members do not trust each other, they may be hesitant to engage in healthy debate and may instead avoid conflict altogether, leading to superficial discussions and poor decision-making.</li>
        <li><b>Lack of commitment:</b> The third dysfunction is a lack of commitment. When team members do not engage in healthy debate and are not fully committed to a decision, they may not be fully invested in the project and may not follow through on their commitments.</li>
        <li><b>Avoidance of accountability:</b> The fourth dysfunction is the avoidance of accountability. When team members do not feel comfortable holding each other accountable, they may not take responsibility for their actions and may not address performance issues or mistakes.</li>
        <li><b>Inattention to results:</b> The final dysfunction is inattention to results. When team members are focused on their own individual goals rather than the team's goals, the team may not achieve the desired results, leading to a lack of success and satisfaction.</li>
      </blockquote></ol> 

      <h3>The 5 functions of a cohesive team</h3>
      <p>Besides describing the dysfunctions Lencioni also answered the five dysfunctions of a team with "The Five Functions of a Cohesive Team". Lencioni proposes that in order for a team to be successful, it must have five key functions:</p>
      <ol><blockquote>
        <li><b>Build Trust:</b> The first function is to build trust among team members. This involves being vulnerable, honest, and authentic with each other, and creating a safe environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.</li>
        <li><b>Engage in Healthy Conflict:</b> The second function is to engage in healthy conflict. This involves encouraging open and honest debate and discussion, and focusing on the issues rather than personal attacks or agendas.</li>
        <li><b>Commit to Decisions:</b> The third function is to commit to decisions. This involves making clear and timely decisions, and ensuring that all team members are fully committed to the decision.</li>
        <li><b>Hold Each Other Accountable:</b> The fourth function is to hold each other accountable. This involves setting clear expectations and standards, and holding team members accountable for their actions and commitments.</li>
        <li><b>Focus on Results:</b> The fifth and final function is to focus on results. This involves putting the team's goals and objectives ahead of individual goals and egos, and prioritizing the achievement of results over personal success.</li>
      </blockquote></ol>
