      <h3>The 5 stages of group development</h3>
      <p>The Tuckman model, also known as Tuckman's stages of group development, describes five phases of team development that teams typically go through as they work on a project or task. These stages are:</p>
      <ol><blockquote>
        <li>Forming: This is the initial stage of team development, where team members are introduced to each other and begin to establish relationships. They are focused on getting to know each other and understanding the goals of the project.</li>
        <li>Storming: During this phase, team members may start to have disagreements or conflicts as they begin to work together. This can be a challenging stage, but it is also an important one for building trust and establishing effective communication within the team.</li>
        <li>Norming: In this stage, team members start to work more cohesively and establish a shared vision for the project. They start to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and work collaboratively towards the common goal.</li>
        <li>Performing: At this stage, the team is fully functional and working together effectively towards the project goals. They have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities and are able to work efficiently and effectively to achieve success.</li>
        <li>Adjourning: The final stage of the Tuckman model is when the project is completed, and the team members go their separate ways. At this stage, the team reflects on their success and the challenges they faced and may celebrate their achievements together.</li>
