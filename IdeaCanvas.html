          <h2>How to Use It</h2>
          <p>Focus on One Idea: Hone in on a specific idea and develop it thoroughly.<br>

          <h2>Mindset</h2>
          <p>Remember, the goal isn't to fill out every section. It's about staying aware of potential blind spots and making cross-connections. The Idea Canvas is designed to be used before other tools to refine a specific idea and long after, as a data collection tool for discovering new combinations. The canvas is available as an SVG file, perfect for MIRO, printing on posters, or adding to PowerPoint presentations.</p>
